## I’m Ben.

### I want to be a designer. 

I’m glad that’s easy to say now, but it was a long road towards that confidence. Lots of trial, error, and everything in between. Mainly, I didn’t have the word “design” to describe what I wanted to do. I like helping people, I like making things, and I love finding creative solutions to tough problems. Who knew design covers all that? Well, you might have, but I didn’t until now.

I’m a senior in college studying sociology, but I’m also interested in a bunch of other stuff like design and tech. College has a lot of goals. You learn social skills, meet life-long friends, gain independence, etc. However, all of these are fun side-objectives while you complete the main quest: figure out what you are going to do after college. So, as I’m about to finish college, the prospect of a future occupation has been on my mind a lot. This is why I’ve been so relieved to discover the world of design.

Previously, I thought design was only about art and small physical goods. In my mind, designers made good-looking posters and fancy chairs. It would be neat to be a designer, but neat is about as far as it got. At this point, I didn’t understand the impact that design could have and as a result, it wasn’t that appealing.

Here’s my current definition of design:

*Design is solving problems for people. Good design has a positive impact.* 

Sure, more could be added, but this feels all-inclusive. If you are a designer, maybe this definition is a no-brainer to you, but for me it was revolutionary. Design was no longer just about art and chairs. It was everything I wanted. It was creative problem-solving. It was helping. It was making stuff with a positive impact. Perfect for me.

Three realizations lead to this definition.

The first breakthrough came from my sociology classes. While sociologists might not explicitly use the word ‘design,’ the whole discipline revolves around it. Sociology’s central theme is that the social, cultural, and physical environment you live in has an impact on you. Often, this environment is decided by others. In other words, the way your environment is designed has a big effect on your life. For example, consider how high-polluting factories consistently get built near poor areas. If you live in one of those areas, then your health is partially determined (designed) by the people who chose to place factories near you. As they pump pollution into the air, the people living nearby breathe it in and die earlier. Someone’s decision to place the factory in that spot is directly responsible for a population’s worse life outcomes. Early deaths, by design.
