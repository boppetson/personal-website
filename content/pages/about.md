### I’m Ben.

#### I want to be a designer. 

I’m glad that’s easy to say now, but it was a long road towards that confidence. Lots of trial, error, and everything in between. Mainly, I didn’t have the word “design” to describe what I wanted to do. I like helping people, I like making things, and I love finding creative solutions to tough problems. Who knew design covers all that? Well, you might have, but I didn’t until now.

Previously, I thought design was only about art and small physical goods. In my mind, designers made good-looking posters and fancy chairs. It would be neat to be a designer, but neat is about as far as it got. At this point, I didn’t understand the impact that design could have and as a result, it wasn’t that appealing.

Here’s my current definition of design:

*Design is solving problems for people. Good design has a positive impact.* 

Sure, more could be added, but this feels all-inclusive. If you are a designer, maybe this definition is a no-brainer to you, but for me it was revolutionary. Design was no longer just about art and chairs. It was everything I wanted. It was creative problem-solving. It was helping. It was making stuff with a positive impact. Perfect for me.

Three realizations helped define design as what I wanted to do.

The first breakthrough came from my sociology classes. While sociologists might not explicitly use the word ‘design,’ the whole discipline revolves around it. Sociology’s central theme is that the social, cultural, and physical environment you live in has an impact on you. Often, this environment is decided by other people. Put another way, how your environment is *designed* has a big effect on your life. For example, consider how high-polluting factories consistently get built in poor areas. If you live in one of those areas, then your health is partially determined (*designed*) by the people who chose to place factories near you. As the factories pump pollution into the air, the people living nearby breathe it in and die earlier. Someone’s decision to place the factory in that spot is directly responsible for a population’s worse life outcomes. Early deaths, by design.

Each green dot represents an industrial facility/factory where pollution is emitted. Notice how facilities are most concentrated in poorer areas.*

Realizing this was a bit horrifying. Suddenly, society’s ills were no longer “just the way things are.” Now, *real people* were responsible for them. Real people made the decisions that left people homeless, hungry, or dead. Real people caused harm. Fortunately, there was a silver lining. With the power to cause widespread harm, also comes the power to do good on the same scale. The difference lies in how you design.

The second realization happened as I was working at a startup during my junior year. My friend founded the company and that’s how I got in. At first, it was a low-stakes hackathon, but quickly the company’s future seemed more promising and the stakes got higher. More was on the line; investors wanted to see results. I could no longer be ‘nice to have around.’ I had to deliver value like a full-time employee. We all chose roles to own so I chose design. I didn’t know anything about design, but I wanted to learn. 

Before I started, the concept that ‘producing value took a lot of work’ hadn’t fully clicked with me yet. In theory, yes, I got it. Making stuff took work. My essays took work. Applying to internships took work. But when talking about working in a professional setting where getting it right was the difference between a company going under or not, I definitely didn’t get it. I didn’t respect the amount of work and deliberate thought that was required to produce something of legitimate value. This mentality reflected itself in how I worked and how I thought about design. As a consequence, I almost got fired from my first real job. 

I did what I *thought* was design, but it totally wasn’t… Sure, I designed things, but that’s not design. That distinction is important. It’s what almost got me fired. Designers solve problems and I wasn’t solving anyone’s problem. I was making stuff for the sake of making stuff. My first project as a “designer” was an extensive style guide for a company of 4 with barely a product and no customers. It solved nothing and was wasted productivity. What was I thinking? Well, I wasn’t thinking and that was exactly the problem. I learned an important lesson. Design (like most professions) is all about thinking. Thinking is most of the work because thinking is how value gets created.

It’s embarrassing to think back on how wrong I was. I messed up real bad, but I grew from it. I started thinking! As a result, my ability to design got a lot better.
