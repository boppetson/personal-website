# TL:DR

For my capstone project in college, I analyzed the usability of all 50 states' unemployment insurance websites. I adapted a set of criteria from the Nielsen Norman Group to assign a usability score to each website. I also looked at possible predictors of a state website's usability: a state's political ideology, historical political party control, racial makeup, and income.

I found that states with more Republican voters in the 2020 election tended to have less usable websites. The same was true for race. States that had a greater percentage of minority groups also had more usability problems.

Notably, there was still a lot of unexplained variance (R squared = 0.19)

### Why this matters

Poor usability hinders people from getting what they want. In the context of government services, poor usability hurts people. 

This matters because people get hurt if government services, especially critically important ones like unemployment, are unusable. 

Most government services are either all online or rapidly moving there. 

Here's a scatterplot with each state's usability score plotted with the percent who voted Republican in the 2020 election:

## Good usability examples

Minnesota had a very usable website. One reason it score highly was its effective usage of breadcrumbs, headers, and a navigation bar.

Rhode Island also did very well. I was particularly impressed by its accessibility settings, letting a user customize their website to their liking.

## Bad usability examples

Nevada's site is a great example of what frequently went wrong for the lowest scorers. The homepage isn't easy to scan and all the important information is hidden in endless PDFs.
