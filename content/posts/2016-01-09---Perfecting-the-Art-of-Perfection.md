## **The Sunday Strips - Calvin and Hobbes**

Bill Watterson authored the highly successful comic strip series, *Calvin and Hobbes*. Every day for 10 years, a new *Calvin and Hobbes* strip came out. Normally, the newspapers that published comic strips limited each strip to just one row and a monochrome palette. However, there was one glorious exception: Sunday. On Sundays, cartoonists were free to submit much larger, multi-row strips in color.  Many beautiful illustrations came as a result of this allowance. 

When Watterson started creating the bigger Sunday strips for Calvin and Hobbes, he encountered a design problem. Different newspapers published different sizes of Sunday strips. Some printed three rows worth of material while others only printed two. This created two possible experiences for the end-user, the reader. Some readers would see all three strips while others would only see two. How could Watterson create a comic strip that works for both?

Watterson realized he had to draw the Sunday strips so that the top row wasn’t essential to the strip’s story, but also in a way that didn’t make the top row feel out of place. The implementation of these rules (i.e. the solution) was so elegantly done every time that I never noticed it until I read Watterson's “Calvin And Hobbes Sunday Pages 1985-1995” where he pointed it out.

Check out the strip below:

What's the story? I see a kid trudging through a not-so-pleasant day until he gets back to his best friend and his day starts getting a whole lot better. 

Read it again, now with the top panel.

I see the same thing, only the message hits harder. The wide paneled freedom of flying in a dream makes the short cramped panels in the middle feel even more dreary. 

Having all three rows makes for a better experience, but those who saw only two weren’t left behind. The lesson: all potential end-users should be able to get the core function out of a design. It should also be implemented in such a way that no one feels left behind.
