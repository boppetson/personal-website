  How I designed a tool to reduce Twitch Streamers's workloads

My last job was at a startup with a team of four. I was not an engineer, which means I worked on everything else.  Business strategy, design, customer acquisition, and more. This was perfect since I could learn a variety of skills and try new disciplines. During this journey of personal growth, I led my first professional project start to finish and launched a product! Here's the story:

### User Research

We knew Twitch streamers generally had a lot of work to do to run their channel and grow their community. We wanted to know what we could build for them to reduce their workload. First, we had to learn about our users. I started by sitting in on a sample of Twitch streams. I noted what each streamer offered to fans in addition to their stream (Discord server, giveaways, etc) and reverse-engineered the work that they would have had to do behind the scenes to make it all happen. For example, if a streamer ran a community Discord server, they would have to moderate the server, post announcements, engage with fans, and more. Afterward, I reached out and interviewed several streamers to learn more about the specific streaming-related work they did consistent basis and their strategies for getting it done. I looked for mindless tasks that the streamer had to do weekly since that work was likely a pain point we could resolve for them through automation.

I discovered that many streamers run Minecraft servers where only Twitch subscribers are allowed to join the server. These “sub-only” servers were very popular with their fans and brought in a lot of subscription revenue for them; however, it required a lot of tedious upkeep from each streamer. To run a server, they would have to collect Minecraft usernames from fans through a form, keep those responses in a spreadsheet, manually check if someone was a Twitch sub, and then add their name to the server’s whitelist. It was painfully laborious. Perfect for us.

### Designing the Product

Based on what I had learned from the streamers, I developed a list of minimum requirements for our product. If we were to build a solution to their problem, it would have to check certain boxes otherwise we wouldn’t be meeting their needs. I brought in our lead engineer to walk through the user flows I had created and made sure they were technically feasible within our limited timeframe. With the user flows, I made sure both the streamer's and their subscriber's experiences were accounted for so neither's needs were left behind. I worked closely with the engineer as they built it, answering questions they had about the design and ensuring the requirements were always being met.  

### Testing and Launch

Once our product met all the minimum requirements, I tested it with a streamer and their fans. It met their needs! The streamer was happy since it reduced the time it took them to run their server from several hours to only minutes each week. Fans were also satisfied since the sign-up process was much easier and access to the server was almost instant.  Before, they would have had to wait a week or so for the streamer to manually add them to the server. 

The user research I'd done had paid off. Yay! I sought feedback and we iterated our product to meet their needs even better. Now it was time to ship and finalize the pricing. Again, collaboration with our lead engineer was invaluable since they knew the uptime costs to run our product. Based on those costs and what I had learned about the spending habits of our target customers, I set the price and we rolled it out. 

My first product was complete!
