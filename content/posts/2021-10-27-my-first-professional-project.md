  How I took my first product from nothing to something.

My last job was at a startup with a team of four. I was not an engineer, which means I worked on everything else.  Business strategy, design, customer acquisition, and more. This was perfect since I could learn a variety of skills and try new disciplines. During this journey of personal growth, I led my first professional project start to finish and launched a product! Here's the story:

### User Research

We knew Twitch streamers generally had a lot of work to do and we wanted to know what specifically we could automate for them using software. I started by sitting in on a sample of Twitch streams. I noted what each streamer offered to fans in addition to their stream (Discord server, giveaways, etc) and reverse-engineered the work that they would have had to do behind the scenes to make it all happen. For example, if a streamer ran a community Discord server, they would have to moderate the server, post announcements, verify the sub/follower status of members, and more. Afterward, I reached out and interviewed several streamers to learn more about the specific streaming-related work they did consistent basis and their strategies for getting it done. I looked for mindless tasks that the streamer had to do weekly since that work was likely a pain point we could resolve for them through automation.

I discovered that many streamers run Minecraft servers where only Twitch subscribers are allowed to join the server. These “sub-only” servers were very popular with their fans and brought in a lot of subscription revenue for them; however, it required a lot of tedious upkeep from each streamer. To run a server, they would have to collect Minecraft usernames from fans through a form, keep those responses in a spreadsheet, manually check if someone was a Twitch sub, and then add their name to the server’s whitelist. It was painfully laborious. Perfect for us.

### Designing the Product

Based on what I had learned from the streamers, I developed a list of minimum requirements for our product. If we were to build a solution to their problem, it would have to check certain boxes otherwise we wouldn’t be meeting their needs.  At this point, I brought in our lead engineer. I walked them through the user flows I’d created and made sure my product design was technically feasible within our limited timeframe. I worked closely with them as they built it, checking in frequently to make sure the end user's needs were being met. 



### Testing and Launch!

Once our product met all the minimum requirements, I tested it with a streamer and their fans. I sought feedback and we iterated our product. It solved their problem! Yay! Now it was time to decide the price. Again, collaboration with our lead engineer was invaluable since they knew the uptime costs to run our product. From there, I added a profit margin and designed the rollout process based on our current growth strategy (another first for me, but that's another story). 

My first product launch was complete!
